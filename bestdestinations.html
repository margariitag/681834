           <p1>
            Mercato, located on Jumeirah Beach Road, is one of Dubai’s most charismatic and best loved shopping malls because of its individual and unequalled ambience. Although Mercato is essentially a community mall, 
            serving the needs of residents in Jumeirah and surrounding areas, it also attracts tens of thousands of tourists from all over the world every year. Spanning 643,067 square feet,
             Mercato is home to over 140 shops and service outlets and prides itself in offering customers a superb variety of international fashion and lifestyle brands,

           <h1> Pura Tanah Lot, Bali</h1>

       <section>
           <p1>
            Pura Tanah Lot was built at the beginning of the 16th century and is thought to be inspired by the priest Nirartha,
             who asked local fishermen to build a temple here after spending the night on the rock outcrop.
            Although foreigners can't enter any of the temples, you can walk across to the main temple at low tide, 
            and it's fun to wander along the paths taking photos and soaking up the magnificent setting.

           <p1>
            Sidemen Village is East Bali's answer to the famous Jatiluwih rice terraces in West Bali – a stunning panoramic view of rural ingenuity and heritage.
             Here you'll find a countryside community down the southern hillsides of Bali's tallest mountain, 
            Mount Agung. Swathes of paddies and plantations around the village are tended by their respective farming communities.
